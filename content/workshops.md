An introduction to R and the Tidyverse, using RStudio.  This hands-on session introduces data wrangling, visualization, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We will provide an overview of the Tidyverse -- a consistent set of data science packages -- focusing on dplyr (data wrangling) and ggplot2 (visualizations) packages.

Data science skills are increasingly important for research and industry projects.  With complex data science projects, however, come complex needs for understanding and communicating analysis processes and results.  Ultimately, an analyst's data science toolbox is incomplete without visualization skills.  Incorporating effective visualizations directly into the analysis tool you are using can facilitate quick data exploration, streamline your research process, and improve the reproducibility of your research.

In this workshop we will focus on ggplot2, a library for R that creates clear and well-designed visualizations and that plays well with other tidyverse packages.

Communicating with stakeholders is a core process in any data science project. For most projects, stakeholder communication happens regularly to ensure that the analysis and outputs are structured to meet stakeholder needs. For some groups of stakeholders, however, the only ability to interact will be in a final presentation. This presentation will focus on strategies for developing a short presentation that summarizes a data science project, including: identifying a compelling story in the analysis; leading with the key takeaways; and presenting results simply, effectively, and visually.

Note: This is not a hands-on workshop. No computers are required.

Getting a new big dataset with a short deadline for data exploration, analysis, and communication of results is a common challenge; doing so with a new team for a DataFest, Datathon, or other competition adds extra complexity.

You'll be assigned a team at the start (or may bring your own). We will provide the large public dataset and challenge; you will get hands-on practice at deciding where to begin, how to break up tasks across a team, and how to manage your workflow to produce the deliverables. The assigned task will be modest; our goal is to improve your metacognitive strategies for successfully managing a data challenge.

Tableau Public (available for both Windows and Mac) is free software that allows individuals to quickly and easily explore their data with a wide variety of visual representations, as well as create interactive web-based visualization dashboards. This workshop will focus on using Tableau Public to create data visualizations, starting with an overview of how the program thinks about data, common data manipulation and loading, and the terminology used. Activities will include a sample data visualization and mapping project, which will give people hands-on experience using Tableauâ€™s basic chart types and dashboard creation tools. We will also discuss publishing to the Tableau Public web server and related services and tools, like the full Tableau Desktop application (free for full-time students).
