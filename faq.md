We would love to have PhD students get involved as consultants during the event.

#### Can I participate as a consuntant if I'm an MS student?

Sure!

#### How large are the teams?

Teams can be made up of 2-5 students.

#### Do I have to compete in a team?

Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you with others in the same boat.

#### What do I need to compete?</h4>

All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on which software you use) and enthusiasm for data.

#### What are the rules of the competition?</h4>

The rules are very simple:

  + No more than five students per team.
  + No fewer than 2 students per team.
  + Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.
  + It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.
  
#### Do we have to stay the entire time?

No. You may come and go as you please. However, you are not allowed to work on the project except while you are on ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> grounds, and at least 3 members of your team must attend the introduction.

#### What can I win?

ASA student memberships, medals, books, fame, glory, or some combination thereof... And you get a t-shirt!
